# Windows configuration and tools

I don't use Windows for development most of the time but every now and then I have a reason to test something. These are the tools and scripts I use to quickly ready an environment! Beware, because I also have some video gaming stuff in here since my primary usage of Windows is as effectively a game console.

## Chocolatey vs Scoop

[Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/) has been my preferred package manager but I'm slowly switching over to [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) as it matures into a tool with closer alignment to the goals of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) in the macOS and Linux world: non-root user installation of development tools. All are great but I tend to prefer lightweight, single-purpose tools for all parts of development.
