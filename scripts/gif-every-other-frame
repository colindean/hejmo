# modified by colindean
#
# This script will take an animated GIF and delete every other frame
# Accepts two parameters: input file and output file
# Usage: ./<scriptfilename> input.gif output.gif

# Make a copy of the file
cp "$1" "$2"

# Get the number of frames
# this had used `grep -o -P` but -P doesn't exist on BSD grep so it wouldn't work on macOS OOTB
numframes="$(gifsicle "$1" -I | perl -nle'print $& while m{\d+ images}g' | perl -nle'print $& while m{\d+}g')"

# Deletion
(( i=0 ))
while [[ $i -lt $numframes  ]]; do
    rem=$(( i % 2 ))

    if [ $rem -eq 0 ]
    then
        gifsicle "$2" --delete "#"$((i/2)) -o "$2"
    fi

    (( i=i+1 ))
done
